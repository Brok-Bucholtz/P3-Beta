# TV Script Generation
### Introduction
In this project, you'll generate a TV script based on the Fox TV show, The Simpsons.  The neural network used to generate the TV script will be an RNN.

You'll be using part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The neural network you'll build will generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.
